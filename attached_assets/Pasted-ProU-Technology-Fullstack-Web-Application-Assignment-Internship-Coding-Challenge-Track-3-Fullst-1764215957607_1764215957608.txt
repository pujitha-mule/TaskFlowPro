Fullstack Web Application Assignment

Internship Coding Challenge – Track 3: Fullstack (Frontend + API + Database)

1. Scenario



You’ve joined a small so0ware team developing an Employee Task Tracker - a complete internal tool

for managing tasks within a company.

The product team has provided the func>onal requirements, and you are responsible for building

both the frontend and backend that work together as one integrated system.

The system should allow:

• Viewing all employees and their tasks

• Adding and upda>ng tasks

• Filtering tasks by status or employee

• Viewing a simple dashboard summary (e.g., total tasks, comple>on rate)

You can use any modern tech stack you’re comfortable with (for example):

• Frontend: React / Vue / Angular

• Backend: Node.js + Express / Python + FastAPI / Java + Spring Boot

• Database: SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB

2. Expected Outcome



A fully working web app that:

• Displays and manages employees and tasks

• Persists data using a real database

• Communicates between frontend and backend via REST API

• Has a clean, responsive user interface

3. Deliverables



Please submit the following via GitHub (single repository or monorepo structure):

• Frontend Source Code

• Backend Source Code

• Database Schema / MigraBon Script

• Sample Data (op>onal)

• README.md that includes:

o Tech stack and architecture overview

o Setup & run instruc>ons (for both frontend & backend)

o API endpoint documenta>on

o Screenshots or screen recording (if possible)

o Any assump>ons or limita>ons
Instructions

• The frontend must communicate with the backend API (no mock data).

• Store all data in a proper database.

• Use modern best practices:

o Frontend: Component structure, state management, responsive design

o Backend: RESTful design, validation, error handling

o Database: Relationships and foreign keys (Employee ↔ Task)

• Use environment variables for API URLs and config

• Keep the UI simple but functional

5. Focus Areas (Evaluation Criteria)



Area What we look for

Architecture Clear separa>on between frontend, backend, and DB layers

API Integra>on Smooth communica>on between UI and API (no hardcoding

Code Quality Modular, readable, and consistent naming conven>ons

UI/UX Clean, intui>ve design and responsiveness

Data Persistence Proper CRUD opera>ons with a database

Documenta>on Setup clarity, endpoint list, and how to test the app

6. Bonus Challenge (Optional)



Add user authenBcaBon and role-based access:

• Admin can add/update/delete tasks and employees

• Regular users can view their assigned tasks only

This demonstrates your understanding of authen>ca>on, authoriza>on, and real-world app flow.

7. Estimated Time



8–10 hours (spread over 2–3 signgs).

8. Example ArchitectureExample API Flow



Frontend AcBons → Backend Endpoints → Database

View all tasks GET /tasks Tasks

Add new task POST /tasks Tasks

Update task status PUT /tasks/:id Tasks

View summary GET /dashboard Calculated from both tableso
